client side
1) Encrypt the file or the contents of the file using AES in CBC mode using the user entered password as the key
2) Hash the plaintext and encrypt the hash using clients private
key (This ensures the signature is verified)
3) Encrypt the key(password) using servers public key

Server
1) Decrypt the aes key using the servers private key
2) Decrypt the content using the AES key obtained above
3) Compute the hash of the decrypted content
4) Decrypt the signature using the clients public key
5) Compare the hashes obtained in step 3 and step 4, if they are same then the signature verification passed, else it failed
